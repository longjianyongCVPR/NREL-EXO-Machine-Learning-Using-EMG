# NREL-EXO-Machine-Learning-Using-EMG
This is an ongoing project to detect sudden perturbations in human movement with data from electromyographic (EMG) sensors. The program will learn the abnormal pattern and help a powered lower-limb exoskeleton decide whether it needs to support torque to bring user to balance.
